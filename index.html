          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>
          I'm web-application developer from Oulu. I like challenges and trying out new things just for fun. <br/>
          I started in DevLAB 27th of august. I wanted to study in DevLAB because its focused on solving problems that are 
          daily life for some people. I was working as a contact person and a programmer and both of those are something that I can do
          very well. I was arranging meetings and was one of the product developers who made it possible to test our prototype
          in a real environment.
          </p>
          <p>
          I'm not afraid of going outside my comfort zone because thats where I learn the most and I like challenges.
          I learn fast and I know my strengths and weaknesess in work.

        <h1>What I learned</h1>
        <p>
          Most of my time in DevLAB I was working on a small device that could help hospital staff to remember to use hand disinfectant.
        </p>  
        <p>
          I learned about prototyping.
          I already knew what prototype was but during my time in there, I learned how to do it effectively.
          Our prototype was ugly, brings out the core features and cheap.
          Ugly because then people then have the courage to give honest feed back.
        </p>
        <p>
          I developed as a team worker. The whole semester was about working in a team on a solution to a real everyday problem.
          We were using scrum, having team coachings and everybody had a role mostly based on current field. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I also learned how to build small devices with <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products" target="_blank">Arduino</a> since our prototype needed a small device, that can handle
          how our prototypes behaves in different situations. With these lessons I got interested into building devices like Arduino,
          for example <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          In DevLAB we had planned way in developing our solutions.<br/> First we define the problem and document all relevant research that will be used later.
          After that we started planning our prototype, how it could solve our problem while reading the documents that gives us the directions. To prove that our solution might be it,
          we ran tests and document the results. Depending on if the tests are succesful, we develop our solution from there. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe this method I've learned in my time in DevLAB is going to be the way I want to develop my applications or other solutions.

      <h3> First prototype </h3>
      <div class="contentWrap">
        <aside><img src="images/firstproto.jpg"/></aside>
        <article><p>
          Our first prototype was build with a paper cup, label and a bike light. On top we just put the
          bottle that our target group used. We kept the prototype in kitchen, so that only the staff is using
          it since they are the ones that are the target group of our solution.<br/><br/>
          Test results were very positive. Usage of the hand disinfectant bottles atleast doubled among
          nurses, only with the lights. With that we knew what direction we should go with our innovation.
        </p><p>
          Our prototype was very simple and cheap but brought out the core function we wanted to test.

      <h3>Second prototype</h3>
      <div class="contentWrap">
        <aside><img src="images/secondproto.jpg"/></aside>
        <article><p>
          Our second prorotype finally had some automation. We used arduino to build a small device and we
          put it inside our prototype. It had a motion detecting sensor, night clock, a RGB-led and 
          of course the code in arduino to run it. It was very interesting to build and I learned how 
          to build small devices.</p>

        <p>But we had a problem; Arduino itself uses alot of battery. When we went to check on
          the prototype after it was being tested for 24 hours in a elderly home kitchen, it was out
          of battery always.<br/>
          We decided not to think it as a problem because it was a prototype after all. We had to change batteries every day.
