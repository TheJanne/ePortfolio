          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>
          I'm web-application developer from Oulu. I like challenges and trying out new things just for fun. <br/>
          I started in DevLAB 27th of august. I wanted to study in DevLAB because its focused on solving problems that are 
          daily life for some people. I was working as a contact person and a programmer and both of those are something that I can do
          very well. I was arranging meetings and was one of the product developers who made it possible to test our prototype
          in a real environment.
          </p>
          <p>
          I'm not afraid of going outside my comfort zone because thats where I learn the most and I like challenges.
          I learn fast and I know my strengths and weaknesess.

        <h1>What I learned</h1>
        <p>
          During my time on DevLAB I learned alot about healthcare policy and problems on that field.
          Most of the time I worked as a contact person in my team, that was working on the solutions for
          poor hand hygiene. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally after Gate 2. We got to develop our prototype so that it contained Arduino.
          Me, Saila and Dat was working on technological part of our prototype. 
          I was mostly handling logic of led lights, Dat was working on our night clock feature 
          and Saila got the movement detetor working.

      <p>Here you can see pictures of our prototype of a product we were developing in DevLAB. 
      On the left is a prototype before Gate 2. Picture is take from a kitchen of a local elderly home.</p>
      <p>The second picture is about our prototype after Gate 2. We were using Arduino to make automated 
      functioning possible. I was mostly working on the logic of lights an</p>
