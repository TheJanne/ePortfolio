        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
        I'm web-application developer from Oulu. I like challenges and trying out new things
        because anything could be learned from them and nothing is impossible in ICT. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I'm a team player who sees himself as one of the parts of a team.

          During my time on DevLAB I learned alot about healthcare policy and problems on that field.
          Most of the time I worked as a contact person in my team, that was working on the solutions for
          poor hand hygiene. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally after Gate 2. We got to develop our prototype so that it contained Arduino.
          Me, Saila and Dat was working on technological part of our prototype. 
          I was mostly handling logic of led lights, Dat was working on our night clock feature 
          and Saila got the movement detetor working.
