          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>
          I'm web-application developer from Oulu. I like challenges and trying out new things just for fun. <br/>
          I started in DevLAB 27th of august. I wanted to study in DevLAB because its focused on solving problems that are 
          daily life for some people. I was working as a contact person and a programmer and both of those are something that I can do
          very well. I was arranging meetings and was one of the product developers who made it possible to test our prototype
          in a real environment.
          </p>
          <p>
          I'm not afraid of going outside my comfort zone because thats where I learn the most and I like challenges.
          I learn fast and I know my strengths and weaknesess.

        <h1>What I learned</h1>
        <p>
          Most of my time in DevLAB I was working on a small device that could help hospital staff to remember to use hand disinfectant.
        </p>  
        <p>
          I learned about prototyping.
          I already knew what prototype was but during my time in there, I learned how to do it effectively.
          Our prototype was ugly, brings out the core features and cheap.
          Ugly because then people then have the courage to give honest feed back.
        </p>
        <p>
          I developed as a team worker. The whole semester was about working in a team on a solution to a real everyday problem.
          We were using scrum, having team coachings and everybody had a role mostly based on current field.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also learned how to build small devices with arduino since our prototype needed a small device that can handle
          how our prototypes behaves in different situations.

      <h3> First prototype </h3>
      <div class="contentWrap">
        <aside><img src="images/firstproto.jpg"/></aside>
        <article><p>
          Our first prototype was build with a paper cup, label and a bike light. On top we just put the
          bottle that our target group used. We kept the prototype in kitchen so that only the staff is using
          it since they are the ones that are the target group of our solution.<br/><br/>
          Test results were very positive. Usage of the hand disinfectant bottles atleast doubled among
          nurses, only with the lights. With that we knew what direction we should go with our innovation.

      <h3>Second prototype</h3>
      <div class="contentWrap">
        <aside><img src="images/secondproto.jpg"/></aside>
        <article><p>
          Our second prorotype finally had some automation. We used arduino to build a small device and we
          put it inside our prototype. It had a motion detecting sensor, night clock, a RGB-led and 
          ofcourse the code in arduino to run it. It was very interesting to build and I learned how 
          to build small devices.<br/>

          But we had a problem with it, Arduino itself uses alot of battery. When we went to check on
          the prototype after it was being tested for 24 hours in a elderly home kitchen, it was out
          of battery always.
